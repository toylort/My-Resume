    Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, gained independence from Britain in 1948, but its post-independence history has been characterised by unrest and conflict, with long-standing struggles for ethnic and sub-national autonomy.

It was long considered a pariah state while under the rule of a military junta from 1962 to 2011 that suppressed almost all dissent and stood accused of gross human rights abuses, prompting international condemnation and sanctions.

A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government led by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year.

But a 2017 army operation in Rakhine state drove more than half a million Muslim Rohingyas to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh, in what the United Nations called a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing".

It damaged the new government's international reputation, and highlighted the military's continuing grip. This was confirmed when Aung San Suu Kyi and her government were overthrown in a coup in February 2021.

    Human Age Beyond 20
Physical Characteristics: After 20 years of age, there is a 10% reduction each decade in the total length of the brainâ€™s myelinated axons, indicating a gradual decline in neural connections and processing speed.
Fertility: Female fertility peaks in the late teens to late 20s and declines thereafter. After age 30, the mass of the human body decreases until 70 years and then shows damping oscillations.
Hearing Loss: Presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss, affects almost half of people older than 75, inhibiting spoken communication.
Osteoarthritis: The incidence of osteoarthritis rises to 53% in the 60-64 age cohort, but only 20% report disabling osteoarthritis at this age.
Cognitive Decline: Intelligence declines with age, although the rate varies depending on the type. Individual variations in cognitive decline may be explained by differences in lifespan.
Life Expectancy: Global life expectancy varies significantly, with developed countries having a median age around 40 years and developing countries having a median age between 15 and 20 years.
